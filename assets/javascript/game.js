// The below pseudocode was mimicked from Phil's example in class!!!! 
// In my own words, I have commented below each function to discuss the meaning or reasoning, so it's not just copied w/o understanding.
// Lastly, I found a website that has explained how to build a word guessing game. Link: https://nostarch.com/download/JS4K_ch7.pdf.
// I used the pdf above to help explain and guide me through the game.

// You have to use math.floor(math.random()) to get a WHOLE number versus a random decimal. 
// I multiplied it by my listofRappers.length for the computer to pick one of the words from my array. 
// Use .length instead of the actual index number in case the length of the list ever changes.
